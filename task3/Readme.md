# Task 4: Protein Mutation Classification

Classify if mutation is active(1) or inactive(0) depending on mutation information.

The mutation information is encoded in 4 letters, where each letter denotes an amino acid and is
fixed to the corresponding site.

For Example: FCDI
- F = Phenylanine, being in the first site,
- C = Cysteine, being in the second site,
- ...

## Idea

Split mutation information into single characters,
Ask sklearn about strings as features 
- OneHotEncoder?
